## Developing 

You can make changes to the code in `node-webkit-src`. 

To easily run your changes, start node-webkit form your terminal and tell it to use `node-webkit-src/` like this:

`webkitbuilds/cache/mac/0.9.2/node-webkit.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit node-webkit-src/`

You may also want to use chrome dev tools. To do this open `node-webkit-src/package.json`. Change this: `"toolbar": true,` And re-run to see the toolbar.
